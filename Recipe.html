        <h4><u>Instructions</u></h4>
        <p><b>1</b>. Prepare the Chicken:
            - Rinse the chicken parts under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.
        </p>

        <p><b>2</b>. Create the Broth:
            - In a large soup pot, combine the chicken parts, halved onion, chopped carrots, celery, minced garlic, bay leaf, dried thyme, and water.
        </p>

        <p><b>3</b>. Simmer:
            - Place the pot over medium-high heat and bring it to a boil.
            - Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 1 to 1.5 hours. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface.
        </p>

        <p><b>4</b>. Remove Chicken and Strain:
            - Carefully remove the chicken pieces from the pot and set them aside to cool.
            - Strain the broth to remove the solids, leaving you with a clear chicken broth.
        </p>

        <p><b>5</b>. Shred the Chicken:
            - Once the chicken has cooled, remove the meat from the bones and shred it into bite-sized pieces.
        </p>

        <p><b>6</b>. Return Chicken to the Pot:
            - Add the shredded chicken back to the pot with the clear broth.
        </p>

        <p><b>7</b>. Season and Add Noodles/Rice:
            - Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.
            - If you like, you can add egg noodles or rice to the soup. Cook until the noodles or rice are tender, following the package instructions.
        </p>

        <p><b>8</b>. Serve:
            - Ladle the chicken soup into bowls.
            - Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.
            - Serve hot, and enjoy!
